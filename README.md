# Elect Karen Candidate!

## Description

This webapp accepts volunteer signups to work for Karen Candidate, running for office in the great state of Michigan (Go Big Blue!). Volunteers are checked by name against a roll of registered voters to determine whether a volunteer is a registered voter.

It's written in Ruby, using the Sinatra DSL. Voter data was seeded with the Faker gem.
